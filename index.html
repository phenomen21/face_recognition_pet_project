  <h1> A face recognition pipeline demonstrated</h1>
  <p>Upload somebody's photo - the "Celeb-finder" will demonstrated what it takes to recognize a face on it</p>
  <p>First, it will search a face on a picture - it takes a specially trained neural network to search for it </p>
  <p>Next it will recognize certain points on the face: eyes, nose and mouth - this is the job for the second neural network</p>
  <p>Next it will rotate and resize the face so the eyes and mouth will be on preset locations - no neural network here</p>
  <p>Finally the third neural network will encode the face in a special series of numbers and it will look for the closest relatives it could find in its celebrities database, which is over 6.3k people</p>
  <p>The Celeb-finder will show you the person it thinks is the closest match to a given face</p>
